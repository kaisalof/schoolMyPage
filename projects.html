            <h3>School project - Spaceship game</h3>
            <p>Fourth year Unity game course in Viope. Graphics came ready but the track and functionality was made by me. This was the first time I made a game or used Unity. I really liked the technology and the visuality. Unity was fun to use and I was
                little surprised how much I liked a game course.

            <h3>School project - Team Tower</h3>
            <p>Second year school project as a group. We made imaginary notes managing system for the Torni hotel. Idea was that each employee of the hotel could manage their own areas notes and complete them or pass to someone else who could complete them.
                There were different departments and the program was a web application. We were learning SQL, Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

            <h3>School project - Work Log</h3>
            <p>Second year school project as a group. We made for imaginary company a browser-based work task log. We were learning how to use Heroku, where our company's work task data were, diagram's for user cases and Gradle to build the project. We also
                used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
